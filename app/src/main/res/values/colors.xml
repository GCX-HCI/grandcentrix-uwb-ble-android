        Define all used colors for the App CI/brand according to the project style guide here.

        Best practise is to give a name to a specific RGB color value and just use it in the theme
        but not directly everywhere else.
        If a color needs to be used outside of the theme we should add a new color which only
        references a specific color name. The name of the color "redirect" should be semantic.

        Example:
            <color name="company_white">#FEFEFE</color>
            <color name="onImage">@color/company_white</white>

        This gives us the ability to replace the color everywhere for a specific semantic.

    <color name="purple_500">#FF6200EE</color>
    <color name="purple_700">#FF3700B3</color>
    <color name="teal_200">#FF03DAC5</color>
